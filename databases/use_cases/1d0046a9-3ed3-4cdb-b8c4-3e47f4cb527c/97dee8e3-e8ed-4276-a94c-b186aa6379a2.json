      "title": "Predicting Median House Value Based on Location and Age",
      "description": "This AI model predicts the median house value using longitude, latitude, and housing median age as input features.  A regression model can be trained to identify the relationship between these variables and the median house value. This could help real estate investors and agencies understand property values in different areas based on geographical location and the age of the housing stock.",

        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average difference between predicted and actual median house values.",

      "prediction_interpretation": "The model outputs a numerical prediction representing the estimated median house value for a given location and housing age. For example, a prediction of $250,000 suggests the median house value in that specific area and housing age is estimated to be $250,000.  A higher prediction indicates a higher estimated median house value.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "Median house value represents the middle value of house prices in a specific area.  The number of unique predictions will be high, as median house values vary across locations and housing ages.  It is a continuous variable"

      "title": "Predicting Median House Value Based on Housing Characteristics",
      "description": "This model predicts median house value based on the total number of rooms, bedrooms, population, and households in a given area. This helps understand how housing density and size impact house prices.  A regression model would be suitable to capture the continuous relationship between these variables and house prices.",

For example, a prediction of $300,000 signifies the estimated median house value for a location with the provided features.  Higher values suggest more expensive areas.",

      "description": "This model uses median income as the sole predictor for median house value. This use case explores the direct relationship between income levels and house prices, providing insights into affordability and market segmentation. A regression model is appropriate because both variables are continuous.",
