      "title": "Predicting Housing Loan Application Approval",
      "description": "This AI use case predicts whether a customer will be approved for a housing loan based on their demographic and financial information. A classification model will be trained on the available data, considering factors such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and existing loan status. The model will learn patterns and relationships between these features and loan approval to make accurate predictions for new applications.",

      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "easy",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model will output 'yes' or 'no' indicating whether a customer is predicted to have a housing loan or not. For example, a prediction of 'yes' suggests a high likelihood of the customer having a housing loan, while 'no' suggests otherwise.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "The target variable 'housing' is binary, representing whether a customer has a housing loan ('yes') or not ('no'). The model will predict one of these two outcomes for each customer."

      "title": "Predicting Personal Loan Application Approval",
      "description": "This use case focuses on predicting whether a customer will be approved for a personal loan.  A classification model will be trained using features such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and existing housing loan status. The model will identify relationships between these variables and loan approval to improve the efficiency and accuracy of loan application processing.",

      "title": "Customer Segmentation based on Demographics and Financial Data",
      "description": "This use case involves segmenting customers based on their age, job, marital status, education, balance, and other available attributes. A clustering algorithm will group similar customers together, revealing valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. This can help the bank tailor marketing campaigns and product offerings to specific segments.",

      "target_variable_understanding": "There is no target variable for clustering. The model aims to discover meaningful groupings within the customer data based on the provided attributes."

      "title": "Predicting Customer Term Deposit Subscription",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.  A classification model will utilize variables like age, job, marital status, education, balance, housing loan, personal loan, contact method, duration of contact, campaign details, previous campaign interaction data and outcome to predict the likelihood of subscription.",
