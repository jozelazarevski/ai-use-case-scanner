      "title": "Customer Churn Prediction",
      "description": "This use case focuses on identifying customers who are likely to stop purchasing from the online retail platform. By analyzing historical transaction data, customer demographics (Country), purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value (RFM metrics derived from InvoiceDate, CustomerID, Quantity, UnitPrice), an AI model can predict the probability of a customer churning within a specific future timeframe (e.g., the next 3 months).\n\nThe model would learn patterns associated with churn, such as decreasing purchase frequency, long periods of inactivity, or declining average order value. Early identification allows the business to implement targeted retention strategies like personalized offers, loyalty programs, or outreach campaigns to re-engage at-risk customers before they are lost.",
      "kpis": [
        "Churn Prediction Accuracy : Percentage of customers correctly identified as churners or non-churners.",
        "Retention Rate Improvement : Increase in the percentage of customers retained among the group predicted to churn after intervention.",
        "Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) of Retained Customers : Total value generated by customers who were successfully retained due to intervention.",
        "Marketing ROI on Retention Campaigns : Revenue generated from retention campaigns divided by the cost of those campaigns."
      ],
      "business_value": "Proactively identifying and retaining at-risk customers significantly reduces revenue loss associated with customer attrition. It is generally more cost-effective to retain existing customers than acquire new ones. This leads to improved customer lifetime value, stable revenue streams, and allows for more efficient allocation of marketing resources towards retention efforts.",
      "target_variable": "ChurnStatus",
      "model_type": "classification",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "medium",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model outputs a probability score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) for each active customer, indicating their likelihood of churning. A threshold (e.g., 0.7) is set based on business needs. If a customer's score exceeds this threshold (e.g., 0.85), they are classified as 'likely to churn'. Example: CustomerID 12345 has a churn probability of 0.78. Since this is above the 0.7 threshold, the prediction is 'Likely Churn', triggering retention actions. CustomerID 67890 has a score of 0.25, predicted as 'Not Likely Churn'.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'ChurnStatus' is typically engineered, not directly present. It would be a binary variable (0 or 1 / No or Yes) indicating whether a customer became inactive (churned) after a certain observation period. For example, if a customer made no purchases in the 6 months following the observation window, their 'ChurnStatus' for that window would be 1 (Churned), otherwise 0 (Not Churned). There are two unique prediction outcomes: 'Churn' or 'Not Churn'."

      "title": "Product Demand Forecasting",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict the future demand for individual products (identified by StockCode). Using historical sales data (Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice), seasonality patterns, and potentially external factors (if available, e.g., holidays, promotions), a time-series forecasting model can estimate the expected sales quantity for each product over a defined future period (e.g., next week, next month).\n\nAccurate demand forecasting helps optimize inventory levels, preventing stockouts of popular items and reducing overstocking of slow-moving products. This involves analyzing the time-series data for each StockCode to capture trends, seasonality, and potential impacts of price changes or other events.",

      "target_variable": "Quantity",
      "model_type": "regression",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "medium",
      "prediction_interpretation": "For a specific StockCode and a future time period (e.g., StockCode '85123A' for the week of 2011-12-05), the model predicts a numerical value representing the expected total quantity to be sold. Example: The model predicts a demand of 150 units for StockCode '22745' next month. This prediction informs inventory planning and replenishment orders. If the prediction is 5 units for StockCode '21787', the company might reduce its stock level for this item.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'Quantity' represents the number of units of a specific product sold. For forecasting, we aggregate this quantity over time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) for each product (StockCode). The model predicts this future aggregated quantity. The range of predicted values can be wide, from 0 potentially up to thousands or more, depending on the product's popularity and the time frame. The number of unique prediction outcomes is essentially continuous within a practical range."

      "title": "Customer Segmentation using Purchase Behavior",
      "description": "This use case involves grouping customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns. Using clustering algorithms, the AI analyzes features derived from the transaction data, such as Recency (days since last purchase - from InvoiceDate), Frequency (total number of transactions), Monetary Value (total spend - from Quantity, UnitPrice), and potentially product category preferences (derived from StockCode/Description) or geographic location (Country).\n\nThe model identifies groups of customers with similar behaviors (e.g., 'High-Value Frequent Shoppers', 'Occasional Bargain Hunters', 'New Customers', 'Loyal Low Spenders'). These segments allow the business to tailor marketing messages, promotions, and product recommendations more effectively, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.",

Improves marketing ROI by focusing resources on the most responsive or valuable segments. Enhances customer experience through more relevant communications and offers. Helps identify underserved or high-potential customer groups.",
      "target_variable": "CustomerSegment",
      "model_type": "clustering",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "medium",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model assigns each CustomerID to a specific cluster (segment), typically represented by a number (e.g., Cluster 0, Cluster 1, Cluster 2, ...). Interpretation involves analyzing the characteristics of customers within each cluster. Example: After running the model, Cluster 0 might contain customers with high frequency and monetary value ('VIPs'), Cluster 1 might have customers with high recency but low frequency ('New Customers'), and Cluster 2 might have customers with low scores on all metrics ('At-Risk/Lapsed'). A specific CustomerID (e.g., 17850) might be assigned to Cluster 0, indicating they should receive VIP treatment.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'CustomerSegment' is not an existing column but the output of the clustering algorithm itself. It's a categorical label assigned to each customer (identified by CustomerID). The number of unique segments (unique prediction outcomes) is determined during the modeling process (e.g., choosing k=5 clusters means there will be 5 unique prediction labels, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The meaning of each segment label is derived by analyzing the average characteristics (RFM scores, product preferences, etc.) of the customers assigned to it."

      "title": "Predictive Next Purchase Item",
      "description": "This use case focuses on predicting the specific product (StockCode) a customer is most likely to purchase next. By analyzing sequences of past purchases for individual customers (CustomerID, StockCode, InvoiceDate), the AI model learns patterns of item co-occurrence and sequential purchasing behavior.\n\nWhen a customer interacts with the platform (e.g., adds an item to the cart, completes a purchase), the model can generate personalized recommendations for the next item they might be interested in. This leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or sequence-aware models to understand transitions between product purchases.",

      "prediction_interpretation": "Given a customer's recent purchase history or current session activity (sequence of StockCodes), the model predicts the probability for each potential next StockCode. The item(s) with the highest probability are presented as recommendations. Example: Customer 14567 just purchased StockCode '22386'. Based on their history and patterns from similar customers, the model predicts the highest probability for '85099B' (0.15), followed by '20725' (0.12) and '22423' (0.10). The system would recommend '85099B' as the most likely next purchase.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'NextStockCode' represents the specific product identifier that a customer purchases immediately following a given purchase or sequence of purchases. This needs to be derived by ordering a customer's transactions by InvoiceDate and identifying the StockCode of the subsequent transaction. The number of unique prediction outcomes is equal to the number of unique StockCodes in the dataset, which can be very large (potentially thousands), making this a challenging multi-class classification problem."

      "title": "Anomalous Transaction Detection",
      "description": "This use case focuses on identifying unusual or potentially fraudulent transactions. An AI model analyzes various features of each transaction (e.g., Quantity, UnitPrice, total transaction value, time of day from InvoiceDate, customer history via CustomerID, Country) to detect deviations from normal patterns.\n\nThe model learns what constitutes a 'normal' transaction based on historical data. Transactions that significantly differ from this norm (e.g., exceptionally high quantities, unusually high value for a new customer, orders from unexpected locations) are flagged as anomalies. These flagged transactions can then be reviewed manually to determine if they are fraudulent or require further investigation.",

      "model_type": "classification",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "medium",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model assigns a probability score or a binary label (0 for Normal, 1 for Anomaly) to each transaction (identified by InvoiceNo). Similar to churn prediction, a threshold is set based on risk tolerance. Example: Transaction InvoiceNo '536365' has features leading to an anomaly score of 0.92. If the threshold is 0.8, this transaction is flagged as 'Anomaly' and sent for review. Transaction '536370' gets a score of 0.15 and is classified as 'Normal'.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'IsAnomaly' or 'IsFraudulent' is typically engineered, often based on historical chargebacks or manual investigations, or it can be the output of an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm. It's a binary variable (0 or 1 / No or Yes). 1 indicates the transaction is considered anomalous or potentially fraudulent, and 0 indicates it's normal. There are two unique prediction outcomes: 'Anomaly' or 'Normal'."

      "title": "Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict the total net profit a business can expect to generate from a customer throughout their entire relationship with the company. The AI model uses historical data including purchase frequency (derived from InvoiceDate count per CustomerID), average order value (derived from Quantity * UnitPrice per InvoiceNo), customer tenure (time since first purchase), and potentially customer demographics (Country) or product preferences.\n\nPredicting CLV helps businesses identify their most valuable customers, allowing them to prioritize resources, personalize marketing efforts, and tailor retention strategies effectively. It provides a forward-looking perspective on customer value, guiding strategic decisions regarding customer acquisition and relationship management.",

Example: CustomerID 17850 is predicted to have a CLV of $5,500 over the next 3 years. CustomerID 14680 is predicted to have a CLV of $350. This information allows the business to invest more in retaining Customer 17850, perhaps through exclusive offers or loyalty programs, compared to Customer 14680.",
      "target variable understanding": "The target variable 'PredictedCLV' is an engineered numerical value. It's calculated based on historical data and predictive modeling, representing the estimated total future revenue or profit from a specific customer (CustomerID). Various formulas exist (e.g., based on average purchase value, purchase frequency, and estimated customer lifespan). The model learns patterns from historical data (RFM metrics, tenure, etc.) to predict this future value. The range of predictions can vary significantly, from low values for infrequent buyers to very high values for loyal, high-spending customers. The number of unique prediction outcomes is effectively continuous."
