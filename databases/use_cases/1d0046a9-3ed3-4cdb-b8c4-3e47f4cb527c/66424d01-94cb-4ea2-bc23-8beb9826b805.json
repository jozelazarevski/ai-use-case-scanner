      "title": "Apartment Price Prediction",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict the rental price of an apartment based on available features.  A regression model will be trained on historical apartment data, utilizing features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location (city and state), and amenities.  The model will learn the relationships between these features and the price to provide accurate price estimations for new listings or potential price adjustments for existing ones.",

      "business_value": "Accurate price prediction helps landlords optimize rental income by setting competitive yet profitable prices.  It also assists renters in finding apartments within their budget by providing realistic price expectations.",
      "target_variable": "price",
      "model_type": "regression",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "easy",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model predicts a numerical value representing the estimated rental price. For example, a prediction of $1500 means the model estimates the apartment's rent to be $1500.  Higher predictions indicate higher rental price estimates.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "The 'price' variable represents the monthly rental cost of an apartment. The number of unique predictions will depend on the range and distribution of prices in the dataset, potentially encompassing hundreds or thousands of unique price points."

      "title": "Pet Allowance Prediction",
      "description": "This use case focuses on predicting whether an apartment allows pets based on other listing characteristics.  A classification model will be trained to identify patterns associated with pet-friendly apartments.  Features such as the type of property, location, and amenities might indicate a higher likelihood of pet allowance.",

      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "easy",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model predicts either \"None\" or a list of allowed pets (e.g., \"Cats,Dogs\"). A prediction of \"None\" indicates the model predicts the apartment does not allow pets; otherwise, the listed pets are allowed.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "The 'pets_allowed' variable is categorical, indicating whether pets are allowed or not. It will have a limited number of unique predictions, likely representing categories such as 'None', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Cats, Dogs', etc."
