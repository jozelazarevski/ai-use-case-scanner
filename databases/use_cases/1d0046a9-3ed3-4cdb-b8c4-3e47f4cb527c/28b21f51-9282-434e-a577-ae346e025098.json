      "title": "Predicting Housing Loan Application Approval",
      "description": "This AI use case focuses on predicting whether a customer will be approved for a housing loan based on their existing attributes. A classification model will be trained on the available data, analyzing factors such as age, job, marital status, balance, and existing loan status to predict the likelihood of housing loan approval.  The model can help the bank streamline the loan application process and make more informed decisions, potentially reducing manual review time and improving efficiency.",

        "Accuracy of housing loan approval predictions: Percentage of correctly classified loan applications.",
        "Reduction in manual review time for loan applications: Percentage decrease in processing time.",

      "description": "This use case aims to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.  A classification model will be trained using customer attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and existing loan information.  The model's predictions can help the bank assess risk associated with individual customers, enabling proactive measures to mitigate potential losses.",
