      "title": "Predicting Order Fulfillment",
      "description": "This AI use case focuses on predicting whether an order will be fulfilled or not based on available order attributes.  A classification model will be trained on historical sales data to identify patterns and relationships between order characteristics (like payment method, store location, product category) and order fulfillment status. This predictive capability allows for proactive intervention and resource allocation to improve fulfillment efficiency.",

      "model_type": "classification",
      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "easy",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model will output a probability score between 0 and 1. A score closer to 1 indicates a high likelihood of the order being fulfilled, while a score closer to 0 suggests a higher probability of it not being fulfilled. For example, a prediction of 0.8 means there's an 80% chance the order will be fulfilled.",
      "target variable understanding": "The 'is_fulfilled' variable is a binary classification target, indicating whether an order was successfully fulfilled (True) or not (False). The model will predict one of these two outcomes."

      "title": "Sales Rep Performance Prediction",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict the total sales amount generated by each sales representative. A regression model will be trained to identify factors influencing individual sales rep performance using historical sales data.

      "title": "Payment Method Preference Prediction",
      "description": "This AI use case focuses on predicting the preferred payment method of customers. A classification model can be trained to identify patterns in customer choices based on order history. The model will use customer demographics and order details to predict the payment method a customer is most likely to choose. This helps businesses optimize their payment processing systems and potentially personalize customer experiences.",

      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "medium",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model outputs the predicted payment method (e.g., 'Cash', 'Credit Card', 'PayPal', 'Bank Transfer').  For example, a prediction of 'Credit Card' indicates the model believes the customer will most likely use a credit card.",
      "target variable understanding": "The 'payment_method' variable is categorical, indicating the method used to pay for an order.  The model will predict one of the unique payment methods present in the dataset."

      "title": "Product Category Sales Forecasting",
      "description": "This use case aims to forecast sales for different product categories. A regression model will be trained on historical sales data to predict future sales based on past trends and patterns.  The model will use variables such as order date, product category, and quantity sold to predict the total sales amount for each product category over a specified period. This allows businesses to anticipate demand, optimize inventory, and improve supply chain management.",
