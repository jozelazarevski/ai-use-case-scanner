      "title": "Predicting Customer Loan Default",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on their existing attributes.  A classification model will be trained on historical data to identify patterns and relationships between customer characteristics and loan default. The model will analyze factors such as age, job, marital status, education level, balance, housing loan status, and contact method to assess the risk of default.",

      "use_case_implementation_complexity": "easy",
      "prediction_interpretation": "The model will predict 'yes' or 'no' indicating whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.  For example, a prediction of 'yes' suggests a high probability of default, prompting the bank to take mitigating actions such as adjusting loan terms or declining the application. A prediction of 'no' suggests a low risk of default.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "The target variable 'default' is a binary categorical variable indicating whether a customer has a credit in default (yes/no).  The model will produce two unique predictions: 'yes' and 'no'."

      "title": "Predicting Housing Loan Application Outcome",
      "description": "This use case focuses on predicting whether a customer will be granted a housing loan.  A classification model will be trained to identify factors that influence the approval or rejection of housing loan applications.

      "prediction_interpretation": "The model will output 'yes' or 'no' predicting whether a housing loan application will be approved. A 'yes' prediction suggests a high likelihood of approval, while a 'no' prediction suggests a low likelihood.  For example, a 'yes' prediction might lead to faster processing of the application.",

      "title": "Predicting Customer Term Deposit Subscription",
      "description": "This use case aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. A classification model will analyze customer demographics, financial information, and contact details to identify factors that influence their decision to subscribe. This model leverages variables such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, housing loan, personal loan, and contact method to predict subscription likelihood.",

      "title": "Analyzing Customer Balance based on demographics",
      "description": "This use case uses regression to predict a customer's account balance based on their demographic and financial attributes. The model will be trained to identify the relationships between features such as age, job, marital status, education, housing loan, personal loan and account balance. This enables targeted strategies for customer relationship management and financial product offerings.",

      "prediction_interpretation": "The model will predict a numerical value representing the customer's account balance. For instance, a prediction of 1500 suggests an estimated balance of 1500 monetary units. The accuracy of the prediction will depend on the model's performance metrics.",
      "target_variable_understanding": "The target variable 'balance' is a continuous numerical variable representing the customer's account balance. The model will produce a wide range of numerical predictions reflecting the balance values."
